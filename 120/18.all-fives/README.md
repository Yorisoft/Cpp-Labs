To run the application, open the Release folder and click on the .exe file.

The numbers printed out to the screen are extracted from 5 different arrays,
AFTER the numbers were generated by specific functions, NOT HARD CODED IN.
The application also allows you to print the numbers to a file. 


### What is this repository for? ###

This application was developed using Visual Studios 15. 
To open and edit the project double the .sln file which will open Visual Studios, or
copy and paste the .txt file into your desired IDE.

### How do I get set up? ###

Run the application/.exe file and hit enter. The application will populate the arrays with 
different sets of number each time. It will go through an array of 5's, then Evens, 
then Odds, then Prime numbers, and finally perfect Squares. Users also have the option to 
print the arrays out to the console.
